# AI Workflow Experiments

A multi-project repository exploring different AI agent frameworks and deployment patterns. It contains three independent sub-projects, each with its own toolchain, dependencies, and documentation.

> ⚠️ **Security Notice:** This repository **does not** track any `.env` files, API keys, service-role tokens, certificates, or other secrets. Every sub-project has its own `.gitignore` that excludes these files. See the [Security](#security) section below for details.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Different sub-projects have different prerequisites. At a glance:

| Sub-project       | Required tools                                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Mastra            | Node.js LTS, npm (or pnpm/yarn)                |
| Hindsight Docker  | Docker 20.10+, (optional) Docker Compose v2    |
| Agno for Todo     | Python 3.10+, pip, (optional) Supabase CLI    |

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-github-repo-url>
cd "AI workflow Experiments"
```

### Choose a sub-project

```bash
cd "Mastra first test"        # or
cd "hindsight docker"         # or
cd "agno for todo"
```

Then follow the **Installation** section in that sub-project's `README.md`.

## 🔒 Security

🔒 **Never commit sensitive credentials.** This repository enforces a strict no-secrets policy:

### Already excluded by `.gitignore` in every sub-project

- `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.env`, `*.env.local`
- `*.key`, `*.pem`
- `secrets.json`, `credentials.json`
- IDE / OS junk (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)

### Before every push

```bash
# From the repo root
git status                                           # nothing sensitive staged
git ls-files | grep -E "\.(env|key|pem)$"            # should print nothing
```

### If a secret is ever leaked

1. **Rotate the key immediately** with the provider.
2. Purge the file from history with [git filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) or [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/).
3. Force-push the cleaned history and notify any collaborators to re-clone.

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-change`.
3. Make your changes **only inside one sub-project** unless the change is cross-cutting.
4. Run `git status` and `git diff --cached` to make sure **no `.env` or key files** are staged.
5. Commit with a clear message and open a pull request.

When adding a new sub-project, also create a dedicated `.gitignore` and `README.md` in its folder.
